3. Replay 6-4-1-5
4. Noone 1-5-6-4
5. Just A Dream 6-4-1-5
6. Whistle 6-4-1-5


#### Vocals: C: 1, Am: 6, F: 4, G: 5
1. Just a dream 6-4-1-5
2. No one 1-5-6-4, the vocal can be a bit off within one beat due to singing.
3. Replay 6-4-1-5
4. Where is the love 1-5-6-4. Doesnt sound that great


### Doesn't work
1. Despacito, Faded: there is a beat that is off before the chorus.
2. Hall of Fame: the song doesn't have a stable beat
3. Numb: dont know why
4. I'm yours: the chords result coming back is messed up. Needs investigation
5. Right here waiting: some bars are off so the song matches with 2nd half
6. Listen to your heart: no weird chords but the variation of orders will mess everything up
7. Real slim shady: 1-5-6-4. Library returns not enough chords.
8. Boulevard of broken dreams: Am C G D, but then the chorus is messed up.


### Potential:
1. Say you wont let go beat. Cant find the vocal but the original works
2. Try havana with Smooth. Investigate Smooth
3. With or without you. Cant find vocal
4. Crying over you Mr.T, Lang tham mot tinh yeu Am F C G
5. Don't matter works with One Last Time. Dont know why.
6. Baby C Am F G

### TODO:
All Star: G D Am C
Akon- Dont Matter (original works). Needs vocal and beat
Whistle - Beat works. Need to extract full and vocal
Demon Beat works. Needs Full and vocal.
