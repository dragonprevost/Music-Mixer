# Music-Mixer

### Update on May 7, 2018

- I tried to mix Just a Dream by Nelly with If I were a boy by Beyonce on Adobe Audition. I downloaded the vocal for Just a Dream and the backing track for If I were a boy and just align them together. Since they have the same tempo and the same chords, it turns out to be pretty good. 
- I tried mixing Love the way you lie with If I were a boy but there is a pause in the first song which makes everything out of sync without editing
- I also tried to mix River Flows in you and Just A Dream with pitch -3 on River flows in you. It sounded great!
- I feel like I need to detect the following:
  + tempo
  + where the chord begins
  + chord transposition for songs that have the same chords but at different transposition
  
- At this point, I think I have the following approaches:
  + get vocals and focus on extracting the tempo, the chord and timing and form a database of that
  + get backing track and detect possible parts to add the vocals in.
  + I can just use backing track of EDM songs, classical music, dubstep music, catchy piano tunes and does not neccessarily have to be backtrack from pop songs.
  + It would be good if I can do chorus, first/second lyrics detections and just apply that to specific time frame
