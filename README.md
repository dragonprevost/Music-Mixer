### Update on May 7, 2018

- I tried to mix Just a Dream by Nelly with If I were a boy by Beyonce on Adobe Audition. I downloaded the vocal for Just a Dream and the backing track for If I were a boy and just align them together. Since they have the same tempo and the same chords, it turns out to be pretty good.
